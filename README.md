### 📂 Assignment 2:(repo named assign 4)  Linear & Logistic Regression

**Objective:** Understand and apply linear and logistic regression for prediction and classification tasks.

**Summary of Tasks:**

* **Linear Regression**:

  * Simple and multiple regression using housing datasets.
  * Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`.
  * Evaluated models using R², MSE, RMSE.
  * Correlation matrix and multicollinearity analysis.

* **Logistic Regression**:

  * Binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.
  * Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
  * Threshold tuning and probability interpretation.
  * Optional multiclass logistic regression using the Iris dataset.

* **Conceptual**:

  * Compared assumptions and applications of linear vs. logistic regression.
  * Explained sigmoid vs. softmax, and why R² isn't suitable for classification.

  * Explained GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB.
  * Spam detection using MultinomialNB.
  * Classification on numeric data (Iris/Wine) using GaussianNB.

* **Decision Trees**:

  * Built decision trees on the Titanic dataset.
  * Preprocessed categorical and missing data.
  * Visualized trees and tuned parameters like `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`.

* **Ensemble Learning**:

  * Compared Bagging vs Boosting.
  * Trained Random Forest and AdaBoost classifiers.
  * Compared performance (accuracy, F1-score) with Decision Trees.
